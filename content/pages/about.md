I have worked as a data scientist, an AI engineer and I am currently an <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/ifruend">Assistant Professor for Computational Neuroscience at York University, Toronto, ON</a>.
This blog covers things that I am generally interested in; data science, machine learning but also music, rock climbing and whatever else I feel I should write about.
