This blog covers things that I am generally interested in; data science, machine learning, programming, startups, but also music, rock climbing and whatever else I feel I should write about.
I have worked in a range of positions as a data scientist, an AI engineer and a <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/ifruend">Professor</a>.
I am currently a Staff Applied AI Engineer at <a href="https://workist.com">workist</a> and I founded the songwriting app <a href="https://oudyo.com">oudyo</a>..
