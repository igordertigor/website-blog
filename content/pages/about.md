This blog covers things that I am generally interested in; data science, machine learning, programming, startups, but also music, rock climbing and whatever else I feel I should write about.
I have worked in a range of positions as a data scientist, an AI engineer and a <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/ifruend">Professor</a>.
Working at <a href="https://untether.ai/">untether.ai</a>, I gained some insight into hardware acceleration for AI and concepts related to discretization of neural networks and compilers.
I am currently a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://verbally.de">verbally</a>.
