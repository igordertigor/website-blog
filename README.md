# Personal Blog

This is the repository for my [personal blog](https://ingofruend.net). Most of this readme contains notes to myself (or anybody who wants to copy my setup).

## Folders

- `docs/posts/` contains the respective posts. I prefixed each post by the date, so that searching them would be easy.
- `docs/images/covers/` contains cover images for the posts. Their basename should be the same as the post they refer to. Furthermore, cover images should typically be 1024 pixels wide and 300 pixels high.
- `overrides` is the regular overrides folder for material for mkdocs templates. The theme is configured in `mkdocs.yml`
